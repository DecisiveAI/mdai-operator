# Current changes
1. Remove configured event/action information from Alert labels 
2. Update tests accordingly
3. Pass configured automations to `event-hub-poc`


## TODOs:
1. Manage `event-hub-poc` spin up? - we can do this with helm unless there is anything dynamic
3. Fix e2e test, write new to cover automation
4. Version?
5. Check if any new validation needed for automation
